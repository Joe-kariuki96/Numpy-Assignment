# Assignment 2 - Numpy Array Operations Summary

The second assignment of the "Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas" course delves into the world of Numpy array operations. The primary goal is to develop a robust understanding of essential Numpy functions by selecting five intriguing ones and demonstrating their usage through modified Jupyter notebooks.

The chosen Numpy functions for this assignment include numpy.reshape(), numpy.split(), numpy.average(), numpy.linalg.det(), and numpy.full(). Each function is explored in detail with three practical examples, showcasing their versatility and applicability.


## Here's a brief overview of the functions covered:

## numpy.reshape(): 

This function proves invaluable for reshaping arrays without altering their data. Through examples, the tutorial illustrates how to transform arrays into different dimensions, from 2D arrays with specified rows and columns to constructing intricate 3D arrays.

## numpy.split(): 

The split function divides arrays into subarrays along specified axes. It is demonstrated through examples of splitting arrays both vertically and horizontally, providing insights into its applications across various scenarios.

## numpy.average(): 

This function calculates the weighted average along specified axes. Examples cover basic arithmetic averages to weighted averages with varying weights, including instances where careful consideration of array shapes and weights is essential.

## numpy.linalg.det(): 

Used to determine the determinant of a square matrix, this function showcases its prowess through examples with 2x2 and 3x3 matrices. The importance of square matrices for this function is highlighted.

## numpy.full():

The full function returns a new array of a given shape and data type filled with a specified fill value. Examples demonstrate how to create arrays of various shapes and data types, emphasizing its role in constructing arrays tailored to specific needs.
